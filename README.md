## 1. Beyond incorporating the invoice_manager database, what other refactoring did you do for this part of the project?
I also create multiple functions for reuse in different pages.
## 2. In your own words, why is it important to use prepared statements and when should you use them?
We can not trust what kind of input users will provide, and to avoid malicious code in back-end we should always use prepared statements.
## 3. How did using a database to manage the data differ from using a session array? Which do you prefer and why?
Using a database will have persistent effect on the data, while session is usually for temporary use.
I prefer using database because it's easier to manage and also has persistent effect.
